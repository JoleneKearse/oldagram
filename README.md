# oldagram

New Scrimba Solo Project

## The Project

Oldagram is a clone of Instagram, but with a twist!  It imagines an app for famous artists to share their self-portraits.  

The requirements and the initial image I was given of the app:

![Requirements: Create first post, Use semantic HTML, Add Hover Effects to the Icons, Oldagram app as viewed on a phone with post by Vincent Van Gogh](https://github.com/JoleneKearse/oldagram/blob/main/screenshots/start.png)

I also completed the given stretch goal: render additional posts using JavaScript.

## My Additions

I added accessibility features like `role` and `aria-label`, made the header fixed, and added additional posts to take advantage of my dynamic JavaScript.

Here's a screenshot:
